# AWS Monitoring & Management: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, AWS Config, Trusted Advisor

A crucial part of running workloads in AWS is having robust monitoring, observability, and governance processes. AWS offers various services to track resource usage, audit changes, and optimize configurations. In this document, we’ll explore:

1. **Amazon CloudWatch**
2. **AWS CloudTrail**
3. **AWS Config**
4. **AWS Trusted Advisor**

We’ll review each service’s key features, metrics, pros/cons, and common use cases.

## 1. Amazon CloudWatch

### Overview
- **CloudWatch** collects monitoring and operational data (logs, metrics, events) from AWS resources and applications.
- Can trigger alarms, auto-scaling actions, or event-based rules.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Metrics**:
   - Basic (5-minute interval) vs. Detailed (1-minute interval).
   - Up to 10 dimensions per metric.
2. **Logs**:
   - Ingest logs from EC2, Lambda, ECS, on-prem, custom apps.
   - Pay for ingestion + storage.
3. **Alarms**:
   - Set thresholds on metrics.
   - Integrate with SNS, Auto Scaling, or other AWS services.
4. **Events (EventBridge)**:
   - Formerly CloudWatch Events.
   - Route events from AWS services or SaaS apps to targets like Lambda, SQS, etc.

### Pros
- **Unified Monitoring**: One place for metrics, logs, events.
- **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with nearly all AWS services.
- **Custom Metrics**: Track application-specific KPIs.

### Cons
- **Cost**: High-volume logs/metrics can get expensive.
- **Complex**: Requires planning for log retention, search, and dashboards.

### Common Use Cases
- Monitoring CPU, memory, network on EC2, RDS.
- Setting alarms for high error rates in Lambda.
- Scheduling tasks with EventBridge.

## 2. AWS CloudTrail

### Overview
- **Audit** service that records API calls and activities within AWS.
- Provides event history for resource changes, console logins, and more.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Event Types**:
   - **Management Events**: Create, modify, delete actions on AWS resources.
   - **Data Events**: Object-level operations in S3 or function-level events in Lambda.
2. **Trail Types**:
   - **Default**: 90-day management event history.
   - **Custom**: Store logs in S3 indefinitely.
3. **Multi-Region Trails**: Monitor all regions in one place.
4. **Pricing**:
   - Management events are free for one copy.
   - Data events cost \$0.10 per 100k events.

### Pros
- **Comprehensive Visibility**: Every API call is logged.
- **Security & Compliance**: Critical for audits and incident investigations.
- **Integration**: Send logs to CloudWatch Logs or S3.

### Cons
- **Data Events Cost**: High-volume S3 or Lambda data events can be costly.
- **Lag**: Some events can appear after a short delay.

### Common Use Cases
- Forensic analysis of security incidents.
- Auditing who made what changes and when.
- Compliance logs for regulated industries.

## 3. AWS Config

### Overview
- **Configuration tracking** service that records changes to AWS resource configurations.
- Evaluate resources against compliance rules.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Resource Types**: Supports most AWS resources, including EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, etc.
2. **Config Rules**:
   - **Managed**: Pre-built by AWS (e.g., checking if S3 buckets are public).
   - **Custom**: Written in Lambda.
3. **Configuration Snapshot**: Captures the current configuration state of resources.
4. **Delivery Channels**: Stores configuration history in an S3 bucket.

### Pros
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automatic detection of configuration changes.
- **Compliance**: Evaluate resource states against best practices or internal policies.
- **Auditing**: Historical timeline of resource changes.

### Cons
- **Cost**: Billed per configuration item recorded + evaluation of config rules.
- **Complexity**: Setting up custom rules can be time-consuming.

### Common Use Cases
- Tracking changes to security groups, IAM policies.
- Ensuring resources match PCI/HIPAA compliance standards.
- Alerting when configuration drifts from a known baseline.

## 4. AWS Trusted Advisor

### Overview
- **Advisor service** that inspects AWS environment and provides recommendations for cost optimization, performance, security, and fault tolerance.
- Certain checks are available for all accounts, while the full set requires **Business** or **Enterprise** support plan.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Categories**:
   - **Cost Optimization**
   - **Performance**
   - **Security**
   - **Fault Tolerance**
   - **Service Limits**
2. **Checks**: Over 100 checks (full access for Business/Enterprise support subscribers).
3. **Alerts**: Summaries of recommended actions.

### Pros
- **Holistic View**: Identifies potential improvements in multiple domains.
- **Actionable**: Provides step-by-step guidance.
- **Integration**: Can generate events for SNS or other services.

### Cons
- **Limited Checks for Basic Support**: Some recommendations are behind a paywall.
- **Context Needed**: Automated checks might not always align with business needs.

### Common Use Cases
- Identifying underutilized EC2 instances (cost savings).
- Checking for security groups with wide open ports.
- Avoiding service limit breaches.
