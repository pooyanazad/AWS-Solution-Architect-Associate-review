# AWS Compute Services

This section focuses on AWS’s primary compute services. While **Amazon EC2** remains a cornerstone of compute in AWS, there are multiple additional services that abstract away server management, container orchestration, or scaling complexities. The services we will review are:

1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
2. **AWS Lambda**
3. **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**
4. **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
5. **AWS Fargate**
6. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

We’ll explore their key features, metrics, pros, cons, and scenarios where each might be most suitable.

## 1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Although discussed in the previous section, EC2 warrants mention here as it’s the foundation of AWS compute services:
- **Purpose**: Provision virtual machines (instances) in the cloud.
- **Pricing Options**: On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances.
- **Scaling**: Manually or via Auto Scaling groups.

### Key Metrics
- **Instance Families**: C (Compute), M (Balanced), R (Memory), T (General), G (GPU), etc.
- **Max Bandwidth**: Up to 100 Gbps on certain instance families.
- **Monitoring**: CPU, network, and memory usage via CloudWatch.

### Pros & Cons
- **Pros**: Full OS-level control, wide selection of instance types, flexible pricing models.
- **Cons**: Requires server maintenance (patching, updates). Startup times can be a minute or more.

## 2. AWS Lambda

### Overview
- **Serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)**.
- Automatically manages the underlying compute resources.
- Charges only for execution time (i.e., when your code runs).

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Maximum Memory**: Up to 10 GB (as of the latest updates).
2. **Execution Timeout**: Up to 15 minutes.
3. **Concurrency Limit**: Default is 1,000 concurrent executions per region (can be increased).
4. **Cost**: \$0.20 per 1M requests + \$0.0000166667 per GB-second (for the first 6 million GB-seconds per month, free tier offers 1M requests).

### Pros
- **No Servers to Manage**: Fully abstracts the infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Scales automatically in response to events.
- **Cost-Efficient**: Pay only for the actual execution time.
- **Event-Driven**: Integrates with S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.

### Cons
- **Stateless**: Each invocation is ephemeral.
- **Execution Time Limits**: Max 15 minutes.
- **Cold Starts**: Initial invocation may have extra latency.
- **Limited Configuration**: Lower-level OS or networking control is restricted.

### Common Use Cases
- Event-driven microservices.
- Data processing, ETL pipelines, and cron jobs.
- Serverless web backends with API Gateway.

## 3. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

### Overview
- AWS’s container orchestration service.
- Supports Docker containers, runs them on a cluster of EC2 instances or with Fargate.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Launch Types**: EC2 or Fargate.
2. **Clusters**: Logical grouping of container instances.
3. **Task Definitions**: Specify container images, CPU, memory, ports, etc.
4. **Autoscaling**: ECS can scale services based on CPU/Memory usage or custom CloudWatch metrics.

### Pros
- **Simplified Orchestration**: AWS-managed solution vs. running your own orchestration.
- **Deep AWS Integration**: IAM roles, VPC, ALB, etc.
- **Choice of Launch Type**: Fargate for serverless containers or EC2 for direct cluster management.

### Cons
- **Less Portable**: ECS is AWS-specific. (Although ECS Anywhere extends it to on-prem, it’s still AWS-based.)
- **Complex Configuration**: Networking, tasks, and cluster setup can be non-trivial.

### Common Use Cases
- Hosting microservices in containers.
- Running batch jobs that scale up or down quickly.

## 4. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

### Overview
- **Managed Kubernetes** service.
- Runs upstream Kubernetes, with AWS managing the control plane.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Cluster Size**: Supports thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of pods.
2. **High Availability**: Multi-AZ control plane by default.
3. **Cost**: Pay for worker nodes + a \$0.10/hr fee per EKS cluster (pricing may differ by region).

### Pros
- **Standardized Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes is a widely adopted open-source system.
- **Flexibility**: Full Kubernetes ecosystem of tools (Helm charts, etc.).
- **Scalability**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, cluster autoscaling.

### Cons
- **Complexity**: Kubernetes has a steep learning curve.
- **Management Overhead**: Though AWS manages the control plane, you still manage worker node configurations, upgrades, and networking complexities.

### Common Use Cases
- Hybrid or multi-cloud container strategies.
- Organizations already standardized on Kubernetes.
- Complex containerized apps requiring advanced orchestration.

## 5. AWS Fargate

### Overview
- **Serverless compute engine** for containers.
- Works with both ECS and EKS to run containers without managing servers.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Per-Second Billing**: Pay for CPU/memory resources used.
2. **Task/Pod Size**: Configure CPU from 0.25 vCPU to 4 vCPU (for ECS), memory from 0.5GB to 30GB. (EKS Fargate specifics may differ slightly.)
3. **Scalability**: Automatic scaling, no need to manage EC2 cluster capacity.

### Pros
- **No Infrastructure Management**: Eliminates the need to provision or manage EC2 instances for containers.
- **Granular Pricing**: Pay as you go for CPU and memory resources used.
- **Security**: Each Fargate task or pod runs in its own isolation boundary.

### Cons
- **Higher Cost at Scale**: For very large or steady workloads, EC2 may be more cost-effective.
- **Less Control**: Limited configuration at the OS or Docker daemon level.

### Common Use Cases
- Microservices that need quick scaling.
- Short-lived tasks without overhead of node management.

## 6. AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Overview
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** offering.
- Automates deploying and scaling web applications.
- Supports multiple platforms (Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Docker, etc.).

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Supported Runtimes**: 14+ platforms as of the last update.
2. **Scaling Options**: Auto Scaling integrated by default.
3. **Monitoring**: Health checks at instance and environment levels.

### Pros
- **Easy Deployment**: Upload your code, Elastic Beanstalk handles provisioning.
- **Managed Updates**: Automatic platform version updates.
- **Integration**: Ties into RDS, VPC, IAM, etc.

### Cons
- **Less Fine-Grained Control**: Less flexibility compared to direct EC2 or container orchestration.
- **Not Ideal for Complex Architectures**: Focused on single-application deployments.
- **Potential Version Lock-In**: Limited to the platform versions Beanstalk supports.

### Common Use Cases
- Quickly deploying web apps.
- Proof-of-concept or pilot projects.
- Teams that prefer minimal DevOps overhead.

## Final Thoughts
AWS offers a range of compute options that cater to different use cases:

- **EC2** is the go-to choice for full control over instances.
- **Lambda** excels in event-driven, serverless architectures.
- **ECS/EKS** handle containerized workloads, with ECS providing a simpler AWS-native experience and EKS offering standard Kubernetes.
- **Fargate** allows container workloads without managing servers.
- **Elastic Beanstalk** provides a quick, PaaS-like deployment method.

Choosing the right compute service (or combination thereof) largely depends on your application requirements, level of desired control, cost considerations, and operational complexity.
