## 1. Amazon VPC

### Overview
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated network within AWS.
- You control IP addressing, subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, and security.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **CIDR Blocks**: Typically a /16 to /28 for IPv4, can also assign IPv6.
2. **Subnets**: Can be public (accessible from internet) or private.
3. **Security**:
   - **Security Groups** (stateful)
   - **Network ACLs** (stateless)
4. **VPC Peering** & **Transit Gateway**: For connecting multiple VPCs.
5. **NAT Gateway**: For outbound internet access from private subnets.

### Pros
- **Network Isolation**: Each VPC is isolated from other VPCs.
- **Granular Control**: Route tables, security configurations.
- **Scalable**: Expand subnets, connect multiple VPCs.

### Cons
- **Complexity**: Designing subnets, route tables, NAT, peering can be challenging.
- **Default Limits**: VPC, subnets, route tables might need limit increases.
- **Cost**: NAT Gateways, Transit Gateway, and traffic egress can add up.

### Common Use Cases
- Hosting secure, multi-tier applications.
- Segregating dev, test, and prod environments.
- Restricting inbound/outbound traffic for compliance.

## 2. Amazon Route 53

### Overview

- Supports routing policies for intelligent traffic management.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Reliability**: 100% SLA for DNS resolution.
2. **Latency-Based Routing**: Routes users to the nearest AWS region.
3. **Geolocation & GeoProximity**: Direct traffic based on user’s location.
4. **Health Checks**: Automatically remove unhealthy endpoints from DNS.
5. **Pricing**: \$0.50 per hosted zone/month + \$0.40 per million queries.

### Pros
- **Global Anycast**: Low-latency DNS resolution.
- **Advanced Routing**: Weighted, latency-based, failover.
- **Domain Registration**: Integrated domain registrar.

### Cons
- **Complex Routing Rules**: Policies like geolocation can be tricky.
- **Cost**: Many health checks or high query volumes can increase cost.

### Common Use Cases
- Custom domain routing for AWS services.
- Health-check-based failover.
- Latency optimization for global users.

## 3. Amazon CloudFront

### Overview
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** service.
- Distributes content globally via edge locations.
- Reduces latency and network load by caching content at the edge.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Edge Locations**: 400+ points of presence (PoPs) globally (as of latest count).
2. **Latency**: Delivers content from locations closest to the user.
3. **Security**:
   - **AWS Shield** integration for DDoS protection.
   - **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** for filtering.
4. **Price Classes**: Control which edge locations distribute your content.
5. **Lambda@Edge**: Run serverless functions at edge locations.

### Pros
- **Global Reach**: Improved performance for users worldwide.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with S3, EC2, and other AWS services.
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales to handle traffic spikes.

### Cons
- **Caching Invalidation Costs**: Charges may apply for invalidating objects.
- **Latency**: Less beneficial if most users are in a single region.

### Common Use Cases
- Accelerating static & dynamic content delivery.
- Streaming media and video.
- Reducing load on origin servers.

## 4. Amazon API Gateway

### Overview
- Fully managed service for **creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring**, and **securing APIs**.
- Integrates with AWS Lambda (serverless), EC2, or other backends.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Types of APIs**:
   - **REST**
   - **HTTP**
   - **WebSocket**
2. **Scaling**: Automatically handles up to tens of thousands of requests per second.
3. **Pricing**: \$3.50 per million API calls (REST), \$1.00 per million (HTTP APIs). Additional data transfer costs.
4. **Caching**: Can enable caching to reduce backend calls.

### Pros
- **Serverless Friendly**: Native integration with Lambda.
- **Security**: Supports IAM auth, Cognito, custom authorizers.
- **Monitoring**: Built-in CloudWatch metrics, logs, and tracing.

### Cons
- **Cost**: High-volume APIs can be costly compared to alternatives (e.g., ALB for simpler use cases).
- **Cold Start Impact**: If using Lambda, the initial request might face cold start.

### Common Use Cases
- Creating RESTful, HTTP, or WebSocket APIs.
- Building microservices-based architectures.
- Providing a unified API layer for multiple backends.

## 5. AWS Direct Connect

### Overview
- Provides a **dedicated network connection** from your data center to AWS.
- Reduces network costs, increases bandwidth throughput, and provides a more consistent experience than internet-based connections.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Port Speeds**: Available from 50 Mbps up to 100 Gbps in some locations.
2. **Location**: Connect at AWS Direct Connect locations worldwide.
3. **Latency & Reliability**: More predictable network performance than internet VPN.
4. **Pricing**:
   - Port-hour charges.
   - Data transfer rates typically cheaper than standard internet rates.

### Pros
- **Consistent Performance**: Lower jitter, more reliable throughput.
- **Cost Savings**: Potentially lower data egress charges.
- **Secure**: Private connection, though encryption requires additional setup (e.g., VPN over Direct Connect).

### Cons
- **Physical Setup**: Requires configuring and maintaining physical link with a network provider.
- **Lead Time**: Provisioning can take weeks or months.

### Common Use Cases
- Hybrid environments with consistent high-bandwidth needs.
- Large data migrations to/from AWS.
- Low-latency financial or enterprise applications.
