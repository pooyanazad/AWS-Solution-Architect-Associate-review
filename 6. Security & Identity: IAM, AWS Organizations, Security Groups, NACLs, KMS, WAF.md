# AWS Security & Identity: IAM, AWS Organizations, Security Groups, NACLs, KMS, WAF

Security and identity management are central to AWS’s shared responsibility model. AWS provides multiple services to help you control access, manage encryption, and ensure compliance. This document covers:

1. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
2. **AWS Organizations**
3. **Security Groups (SG)**
4. **Network ACLs (NACLs)**
5. **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**
6. **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**

We will explore each service’s purpose, key features, pros, cons, and common use cases.

---
## 1. AWS IAM

### Overview
- **Identity and Access Management**: Controls who can access AWS resources.
- Uses **policies** (JSON documents) to allow or deny specific actions on resources.
- Includes users, groups, and roles.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Users & Groups**: By default, up to 5,000 IAM users.
2. **Policies**: Up to 10,000 managed policies per account.
3. **MFA**: Stronger authentication with multi-factor devices.
4. **Role Delegation**: IAM roles for EC2, Lambda, etc., instead of embedding keys.

### Pros
- **Granular Control**: Fine-grained permissions follow least privilege.
- **Federation**: Integrates with corporate directories (AD/SSO).
- **Free**: No additional cost for using IAM itself.

### Cons
- **Complex Policies**: JSON structure can be error-prone.
- **Scaling Challenges**: Managing thousands of users/policies can get unwieldy.

### Common Use Cases
- Controlling access to S3 buckets, EC2, or RDS.
- Enforcing least-privilege best practices.
- Federating on-prem AD users.

## 2. AWS Organizations

### Overview
- **Account management** service for grouping and centrally managing multiple AWS accounts.
- Includes consolidated billing, service control policies (SCPs), and organizational units (OUs).

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Organization Structure**:
   - Up to 5 levels of nested OUs.
   - Each OU can contain multiple AWS accounts.
2. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Restrict what services or actions are allowed in member accounts.
3. **Consolidated Billing**: Single bill for all member accounts.

### Pros
- **Central Management**: Simplifies multi-account governance.
- **Security**: SCPs enforce consistent restrictions.
- **Cost Optimization**: Consolidated billing can reduce overhead.

### Cons
- **Complex OU Hierarchy**: Designing structure for large enterprises can be tricky.
- **Policy Scope**: SCPs affect entire accounts (coarse-grained control).

### Common Use Cases
- Large enterprises with multiple AWS accounts.
- Isolating dev, test, and production workloads.
- Applying global compliance or security guardrails.

## 3. Security Groups (SG)

### Overview
- **Virtual firewalls** that act at the instance or ENI (Elastic Network Interface) level.
- **Stateful**: Return traffic is automatically allowed if outgoing traffic is permitted.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Default Limits**: Up to 5 SGs per ENI (can be increased), 60 inbound/outbound rules per SG.
2. **Instance-Level**: Rules apply to instances in the same VPC.
3. **No Deny**: Only allow rules; no explicit deny statements.

### Pros
- **Easy Configuration**: Focus on allowed inbound/outbound traffic.
- **Stateful**: Simplifies rule definition.
- **No Extra Cost**: Security groups are free.

### Cons
- **Lack of Granular Denies**: Must rely on NACLs or other controls to explicitly deny.
- **Rule Limit**: Large numbers of rules can become cumbersome.

### Common Use Cases
- Restricting inbound access to EC2 instances.
- Filtering traffic in a multi-tier architecture.

---
## 4. Network ACLs (NACLs)

### Overview
- **Stateless** network-level firewalls at the subnet boundary.
- Evaluate inbound and outbound rules in numeric order.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Subnet-Level**: Each subnet in a VPC can have one NACL.
2. **Inbound & Outbound Rules**: Each rule can allow or deny specific traffic.
3. **Stateless**: Response traffic must be explicitly allowed.

### Pros
- **Explicit Denies**: Can block specific IPs or ports.
- **Subnet-Wide**: Protect entire subnets.

### Cons
- **Complex**: Requires matching inbound/outbound rules.
- **Limited Rule Capacity**: Often fewer rules than security groups.

### Common Use Cases
- Adding an additional layer of security.
- Explicitly blocking malicious IP ranges.

## 5. AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

### Overview
- **Managed service** for creating and controlling cryptographic keys.
- Integrates with other AWS services (e.g., S3, EBS, RDS) for encryption.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Customer Master Keys (CMKs)**: Default limit of 1,000 keys per account (can be increased).
2. **FIPS 140-2**: KMS can use validated hardware security modules.
3. **Envelope Encryption**: Reduces overhead by encrypting data keys with CMK.

### Pros
- **Central Key Management**: Single place to create, rotate, and revoke keys.
- **Deep AWS Integration**: One-click encryption in many AWS services.
- **Logging & Auditing**: KMS API calls tracked in CloudTrail.

### Cons
- **Cost**: CMK and usage fees, especially with frequent encryption/decryption calls.
- **Regional**: Keys cannot leave the region; multi-region replication requires special setups.

### Common Use Cases
- Encrypting data at rest in S3, EBS, RDS, etc.
- Managing keys for custom applications.
- Meeting compliance requirements around encryption.

## 6. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)

### Overview
- **Web Application Firewall** for filtering, monitoring, and blocking malicious HTTP/S traffic.
- Can be placed in front of CloudFront, ALB, or API Gateway.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Rules**:
   - **Managed Rules**: Pre-configured by AWS or partners.
   - **Custom Rules**: Block/allow specific patterns.
2. **Pricing**: Pay for WAF capacity units (WCUs) plus the number of rules.
3. **Logging & Metrics**: Integrates with CloudWatch and Kinesis Firehose.

### Pros
- **Protection**: Blocks common exploits (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
- **Integration**: Works with CloudFront, Application Load Balancers, API Gateway.
- **Flexibility**: Combine managed and custom rules.

### Cons
- **Costs**: Rule pricing can add up for large rule sets.
- **Rule Maintenance**: Tuning rule sets may require security expertise.

### Common Use Cases
- Protecting web applications from OWASP Top 10 threats.
- Filtering malicious bots.
- Rate-limiting specific IP addresses.

## Final Thoughts
These security and identity services work in tandem to protect AWS environments:
- **IAM**: Who can do what across AWS.
- **Organizations**: Multi-account governance and billing.
- **Security Groups & NACLs**: Network-layer protection.
- **KMS**: Central key management for encryption.
- **WAF**: Application-layer firewall for web services.

Implementing layered security (defense in depth) ensures robust protection. Leveraging best practices—such as least-privilege IAM, proper VPC segmentation, and encrypted data at rest—helps you maintain a secure and compliant AWS infrastructure.
