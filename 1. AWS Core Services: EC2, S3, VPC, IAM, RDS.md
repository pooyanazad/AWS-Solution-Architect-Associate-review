# AWS Core Services: EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, RDS

When architecting solutions in AWS, five services commonly serve as fundamental building blocks:

1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
3. **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
4. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
5. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**

This document offers a comprehensive review of these core services, including numerical metrics, performance benchmarks, pros and cons, and key comparisons to aid in decision-making.

## 1. Amazon EC2
### What is EC2?
- **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- You can launch virtual machines (instances) with a variety of operating systems and hardware profiles.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing, plus Reserved and Spot Instance options.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Instance Types**: Over 300+ instance types across families (e.g., C, M, R, T, G) optimized for compute, memory, storage, GPU, etc.
2. **Pricing Models**:
   - **On-Demand**: No long-term commitment, highest cost.
   - **Reserved Instances**: Up to ~72% savings over On-Demand (depending on term length and payment option).
   - **Spot Instances**: Up to 90% savings, but can be interrupted.
3. **Networking**: Supports network bandwidth up to 100 Gbps on certain instances.
4. **Scaling**: Automated with EC2 Auto Scaling groups.
5. **Regions & Availability Zones**: Available in all AWS Regions, typically with 3 or more AZs per region.

### Pros
- **High Flexibility**: Wide range of OS, CPU, RAM, and storage configurations.
- **Auto Scaling**: Adapt to changing traffic automatically.
- **Choice of Pricing Models**: Optimize costs for various workloads.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with other AWS services (e.g., S3, IAM, CloudWatch).

### Cons
- **Management Overhead**: Requires patching, OS updates, and configuration.
- **Longer Startup Time**: Launching instances or scaling might take ~1-2 minutes.
- **Potential for Over-provisioning**: If not optimized, you can pay for unused capacity.

### Common Comparisons
- **EC2 vs. Lambda**: EC2 offers complete control of the underlying OS; Lambda is fully managed serverless.
- **EC2 vs. Containers (ECS/EKS)**: EC2-based solutions require managing servers, whereas containers abstract much of the OS layer.

## 2. Amazon S3
### What is S3?
- **Simple Storage Service (S3)** is highly scalable object storage.
- Stores data as objects in buckets, each object can be up to 5 TB.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 nines) per year.
2. **Availability**: 99.99% availability SLA for Standard storage.
3. **Performance**: Up to thousands of PUT/GET requests per second, scalable by design.
4. **Latency**: Generally 100-200 ms for first byte retrieval in typical scenarios, though can vary.
5. **Storage Classes**:
   - **S3 Standard**: Frequent access
   - **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Automatically optimizes cost by moving data to different tiers.
   - **S3 Standard-IA**: Infrequent Access, ~99.9% availability.
   - **S3 One Zone-IA**: Cheaper, stores data in one AZ.
   - **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**: Archival, retrieval in milliseconds, lower cost.
   - **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: Retrieval in minutes or hours.
   - **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: Lowest cost, retrieval in ~12-48 hours.

### Pros
- **Massive Scalability**: Virtually unlimited storage.
- **High Durability**: 11 nines with automatic redundancy.
- **Flexible Classes**: Cost optimization across different storage tiers.
- **Event Triggers**: Integrates with Lambda, SNS, SQS.

### Cons
- **Object-based**: Not ideal for block-level manipulation (use EBS or EFS for that).
- **Eventually Consistent**: Some operations (like overwriting or deleting objects) can take time to propagate.
- **Data Egress Costs**: Downloading data over the internet can be expensive.

### Common Comparisons
- **S3 vs. EBS**: Object storage vs. block storage.
- **S3 vs. EFS**: S3 is object-based, EFS is file-based.
- **S3 vs. Glacier**: Standard S3 for regular access, Glacier primarily for archival.

## 3. Amazon VPC
### What is VPC?
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated cloud network.
- You control IP addresses, subnets, route tables, NAT, gateways, security settings.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **CIDR Blocks**: Define IPv4 or IPv6 ranges up to /16 for IPv4.
2. **Subnets**: Typically recommended to split into multiple subnets (public, private, DB) for layered security.
3. **Bandwidth**: Traffic in a VPC can scale up to tens of Gbps, depending on instance types.
4. **Security**:
   - **Security Groups**: Statefully filter inbound/outbound traffic.
   - **NACLs**: Stateless layer at the subnet level.

### Pros
- **Granular Network Control**: IP addressing, routing, firewall rules.
- **Isolation**: Each VPC is logically isolated from others.
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Use VPN, AWS Direct Connect to extend on-premises networks.

### Cons
- **Complexity**: Designing subnets, route tables, NAT, and peering can get complicated.
- **Resource Limits**: Default VPC limits (e.g., route tables, NAT gateways) can require increases.

### Common Comparisons
- **VPC vs. Traditional Data Center**: VPC is virtual, scalable, and managed, while on-prem requires physical network management.
- **VPC vs. Shared Hosting**: VPC is dedicated to your environment, more control vs. a multi-tenant environment.

## 4. AWS IAM
### What is IAM?
- **Identity and Access Management** controls access to AWS services.
- Uses JSON-based policies to grant or deny permissions.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Users & Groups**: Can create up to 5,000 IAM users per AWS account by default.
2. **Policies**: Inline or managed; can have up to 10,000 customer-managed policies.
3. **Roles**: Delegation of permissions to services (e.g., EC2, Lambda), no need for embedded credentials.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Highly recommended for all privileged accounts.

### Pros
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Granular permissions using resource-level policies.
- **Central Management**: Integrates with AWS Organizations to manage multiple accounts.
- **Security Best Practices**: Enforce least privilege and MFA.

### Cons
- **Complex Policy Structures**: JSON syntax can be error-prone.
- **Hard to Audit at Scale**: Many users and policies can become unwieldy.

### Common Comparisons
- **IAM vs. AWS SSO**: IAM is fundamental; AWS SSO provides streamlined user management across multiple accounts.
- **Inline Policy vs. Managed Policy**: Managed policies are reusable, inline are embedded into a single user/role.

## 5. Amazon RDS
### What is RDS?
- **Relational Database Service** is a managed service that simplifies provisioning, operating, and scaling relational databases.
- Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Aurora.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Availability**: Option for Multi-AZ deployments for ~99.95% to 99.99% availability.
2. **Automated Backups**: Point-in-time recovery (PITR) typically up to 35 days.
3. **Maximum Storage**: Up to 64 TB for certain engines.
4. **Read Replicas**:
   - Up to 5 for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.
   - Aurora can support up to 15.
5. **Performance**:
   - Aurora offers up to 5x throughput vs. standard MySQL.
   - Up to 64 vCPUs and hundreds of GiB of memory, depending on instance class.

### Pros
- **Managed Service**: Handles backups, patching, replication.
- **Scaling**: Vertical scaling of instance sizes, read replicas for horizontal scaling.
- **Security**: VPC, KMS encryption at rest, integration with IAM.

### Cons
- **Limited OS-Level Access**: Cannot modify the database environment as fully as on EC2.
- **Licensing Costs**: For Oracle or SQL Server, licensing can be higher.
- **Not Serverless**: Except for Aurora Serverless, which is limited to certain engine versions.

### Common Comparisons
- **RDS vs. Aurora**: Aurora is an AWS proprietary relational engine with better performance.
- **RDS vs. DynamoDB**: Relational vs. NoSQL key-value store.
- **RDS on EC2 vs. RDS Managed**: More control vs. reduced operational overhead.
