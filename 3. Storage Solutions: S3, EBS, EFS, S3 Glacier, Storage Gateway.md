## 1. Amazon S3

### Overview
- **Object storage** service designed for high scalability, durability, and availability.
- Stores data as objects in **buckets**.
- Achieves **99.999999999%** (11 nines) durability.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **File Size Limit**: Each object can be up to 5 TB.
2. **Availability SLA**: 99.99% for S3 Standard.

- Flexible data tiering for cost optimization.
- Native event notifications (to Lambda, SNS, SQS).
- Easy integration with many AWS services.

### Cons
- **Eventually Consistent** for some operations.
- **Object Storage**, so not suitable for block-level changes.
- **Egress Costs** can add up for frequent data transfers outside AWS.

### Common Use Cases

   - **io1/io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)**: High-performance volumes with guaranteed IOPS.
   - **st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)**: Optimized for streaming workloads.
   - **sc1 (Cold HDD)**: Lowest-cost HDD for infrequent access.
2. **Max Size**: Up to 16 TiB per volume (some volumes can go up to 64 TiB in certain regions).
3. **Performance**: gp3 supports up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s throughput.
4. **Availability**: Replicated within the same Availability Zone.

### Pros
- **Low Latency**: Ideal for databases and transactional workloads.
- **Resizable**: You can increase volume size, adjust performance.
- **Snapshots**: Point-in-time backups that can be used to create new volumes or stored in S3.

### Cons
- **AZ-Specific**: An EBS volume is only accessible within its specific AZ.
- **Cost**: High-performance volumes can get expensive.
- **Not a Shared File System**: Tied to one EC2 instance at a time (except multi-attach for some volume types, but with limitations).

### Common Use Cases
- Primary storage for EC2-based databases.
- OS volumes for EC2 instances.
- Transaction-heavy or low-latency applications.

## 3. Amazon EFS

### Overview
- **Managed NFS (Network File System)** for use with AWS services and on-prem resources.
- Fully serverless, scales automatically to petabyte-scale.
- Supports concurrent connections from multiple instances.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Performance Modes**:
   - **General Purpose**: Lower latency, recommended for the majority of workloads.
   - **Max I/O**: Scales to higher levels of aggregate throughput with slightly higher latency.
2. **Throughput Modes**:
   - **Bursting**: Base throughput with the ability to burst.
   - **Provisioned**: Specify throughput independently of storage size.
3. **Latency**: Typically single-digit to tens of milliseconds for most operations.
4. **Availability & Durability**: Stores data redundantly across multiple AZs within a region.

### Pros
- **Shared File System**: Multiple EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda can share.
- **Elastic Scale**: Capacity grows and shrinks automatically.
- **Managed**: No provisioning of file servers or storage volumes.

### Cons
- **Higher Cost** compared to EBS for the same capacity.
- **NFS Overhead**: Slight performance penalty vs. local storage.
- **Latency** can be higher than EBS for certain I/O patterns.

### Common Use Cases
- Content management, home directories, media storage.
- Big data analytics requiring parallel access.
- Lift-and-shift of on-prem NFS workloads.

## 4. Amazon S3 Glacier

### Overview
- **Archival storage** solution with extremely low cost.
- Multiple access tiers for different retrieval speeds.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Storage Classes**:
   - **Glacier Instant Retrieval**: Millisecond access.
   - **Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier)**: Minutes to hours.
   - **Glacier Deep Archive**: 12–48 hours.
2. **Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 nines) (like standard S3).
3. **Cost**: As low as ~$0.00099 per GB-month for Deep Archive in some regions.
4. **Retrieval Fees**: Charged by the amount of data retrieved.

### Pros
- **Ultra Low Cost** for long-term data storage.
- **High Durability** ensures data integrity over time.
- **Integration with S3** for easy lifecycle transitions.

### Cons
- **Long Retrieval Times** in some tiers.
- **Access Costs** can be high if frequent retrieval is needed.
- **No Real-Time Access** in certain tiers (like Deep Archive).

### Common Use Cases
- Regulatory and compliance archives.
- Long-term backups of infrequently accessed data.

## 5. AWS Storage Gateway

### Overview
- Hybrid cloud storage service providing **on-premise** applications with access to AWS cloud storage.
- Presents standard storage protocols (iSCSI, SMB, NFS) while storing data in AWS.

### Gateway Types
1. **File Gateway**: Serves as an NFS/SMB file interface, stores data in S3.
2. **Volume Gateway**:
   - **Cached Volumes**: Frequently accessed data cached on-prem, full dataset in S3.
   - **Stored Volumes**: Entire dataset on-prem with asynchronous backups to AWS.
3. **Tape Gateway**: Virtual tape library (VTL) that writes backups to S3 and optionally archives to Glacier.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
- **File Gateway Performance**: Dependent on local cache and network bandwidth.
- **Volume Gateway**: Typically iSCSI with local disk caching.
- **Tape Gateway**: Emulates tape devices for backup software, up to 1 PB of capacity per gateway.

### Pros
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Smooth integration for on-premises to AWS.
- **Reduce On-Prem Storage**: Offload data to cheaper AWS storage.
- **Easy Migration**: Minimal changes to existing backup or file-sharing workflows.

### Cons
- **Network Dependence**: Requires stable, high-bandwidth link for optimum performance.
- **Complexity**: Multiple modes and configurations can be confusing.
- **Caching Constraints**: Performance heavily relies on local cache size and type.

### Common Use Cases
- Extending on-prem file shares to the cloud.
- Offsite backups to S3 and Glacier.
- Replacing physical tape infrastructure with virtual tapes.
