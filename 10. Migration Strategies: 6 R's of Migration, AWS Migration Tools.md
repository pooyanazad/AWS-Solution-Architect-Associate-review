# Migration Strategies: The 6 R’s & AWS Migration Tools

Migrating to AWS involves a mix of strategic planning, technical expertise, and organizational readiness. AWS provides methodologies and tools to help streamline this process. This document covers:

1. **The 6 R’s of Migration**
2. **AWS Migration Tools**

We will review each strategy in the 6 R’s approach and explore key AWS tools that facilitate migrations.

## 1. The 6 R’s of Migration

### Overview
Amazon’s **6 R’s** framework offers different paths to move applications from on-premises to the cloud:
1. **Rehost** (“Lift-and-Shift”)
2. **Replatform** (“Lift, Tinker, and Shift”)
3. **Repurchase** (Move to a new solution/SaaS)
4. **Refactor/Re-Architect**
5. **Retire**
6. **Retain** (Revisit later)

Understanding each approach helps organizations choose the right migration path for each application.

### 1. Rehost (“Lift-and-Shift”)
- **Description**: Move applications from on-premises to AWS without significant changes.
- **Pros**: Fastest to implement, minimal code modifications.
- **Cons**: May not leverage cloud-native features, potential inefficiencies in cost or performance.
- **Tools**: AWS Server Migration Service (SMS), AWS Application Migration Service.

### 2. Replatform (“Lift, Tinker, and Shift”)
- **Description**: Make some optimizations (e.g., moving from self-managed databases to Amazon RDS) without changing the core architecture.
- **Pros**: Some cost optimization and partial modernization.
- **Cons**: Requires moderate effort to reconfigure.
- **Tools**: AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), Docker containers on ECS.

### 3. Repurchase (Move to a new solution)
- **Description**: Migrate to a SaaS application or use a commercial off-the-shelf solution on AWS Marketplace.
- **Pros**: Avoids resource-heavy migrations of old systems.
- **Cons**: Might require retraining staff, data migration complexities.
- **Tools**: AWS Marketplace for SaaS solutions, third-party solutions.

### 4. Refactor/Re-Architect
- **Description**: Rewrite the application to be cloud-native (e.g., microservices, serverless).
- **Pros**: Maximum benefits of scalability, cost optimization, agility.
- **Cons**: Highest effort and risk, extensive changes to code base.
- **Tools**: AWS SAM, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, or container-based refactoring.

### 5. Retire
- **Description**: Decommission the application if it’s no longer needed.
- **Pros**: Eliminates unnecessary costs.
- **Cons**: Potential data archival or compliance considerations.
- **Tools**: AWS Backup, S3 Glacier for archiving data.

### 6. Retain (Revisit later)
- **Description**: Keep the application on-premises for the time being due to business, compliance, or technical reasons.
- **Pros**: Avoids unnecessary migration efforts.
- **Cons**: Potential for technical debt if you do not revisit later.
- **Tools**: Typically on-prem management tools, partial integration with AWS hybrid services.

## 2. AWS Migration Tools

### 1. AWS Migration Hub
- **Overview**: Central location to track migrations across multiple AWS and partner tools.
- **Pros**: Provides visibility into each application’s migration status.
- **Cons**: Not a direct migration tool; purely for tracking.
- **Use Cases**: Large-scale migrations with multiple teams.

### 2. AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)
- **Overview**: Automates lift-and-shift migrations by replicating on-prem servers to AWS.
- **Key Features**:
  - Continuous block-level replication.
  - Minimal downtime during cutover.
- **Pros**: Simplifies rehosting large numbers of servers.
- **Cons**: Doesn’t modernize applications.
- **Use Cases**: Quick rehost migrations.

### 3. AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
- **Overview**: Migrate databases to AWS with minimal downtime.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports homogeneous (e.g., Oracle to Oracle) and heterogeneous (e.g., Oracle to Aurora) migrations.
  - Continuous replication for near-zero downtime.
- **Pros**: Comprehensive engine support, incremental data sync.
- **Cons**: May require schema transformation with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT).
- **Use Cases**: Database replatforming, cross-region replication, data warehouse migrations.

### 4. AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)
- **Overview**: Agentless service to migrate on-premises VMware/Hyper-V/SCVMM VMs to AWS.
- **Key Features**:
  - Incremental replication of live server volumes.
  - Automated conversion to AMIs.
- **Pros**: Simple, straightforward for small to medium migrations.
- **Cons**: Not as feature-rich as MGN.
- **Use Cases**: Basic lift-and-shift of virtual machines.

### 5. AWS Snow Family (Snowball, Snowcone, Snowmobile)
- **Overview**: Physical devices for offline data transfer.
- **Snowball**: Up to 80 TB per device.
- **Snowmobile**: Up to 100 PB in a shipping container.
- **Pros**: Cost-effective and secure for large data sets.
- **Cons**: Physical transport time can be significant.
- **Use Cases**: Data center decommission, large archives, low connectivity environments.

## Migration Best Practices
1. **Discovery & Assessment**:
   - Inventory applications and dependencies.
   - Determine which of the 6 R’s apply.
2. **Plan for Performance & Scalability**:
   - Right-size EC2 instances, or choose serverless where possible.
   - Modernize databases to fully managed services.
3. **Security & Compliance**:
   - Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
   - Use IAM roles instead of hardcoding credentials.
4. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Test migrations in a lower environment.
   - Validate application performance post-migration.
5. **Cutover & Optimization**:
   - Choose minimal downtime or zero downtime approaches.
   - Optimize cost and performance once stable on AWS.

## Final Thoughts
The **6 R’s** framework provides a structured approach to migrating applications to AWS, from simple lift-and-shift to complete cloud-native re-architecture. Leveraging **AWS Migration Tools** like **Application Migration Service**, **DMS**, and the **Snow Family** can streamline the process, reduce downtime, and ensure data integrity.

Successful migrations involve thorough planning, appropriate tool selection, and a clear understanding of each application’s requirements. A well-executed migration strategy often results in improved agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for your workloads in the cloud.
