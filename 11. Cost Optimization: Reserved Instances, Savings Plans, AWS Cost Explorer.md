# Cost Optimization: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, AWS Cost Explorer

Cost optimization is a core tenant of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. AWS offers multiple ways to reduce and control costs, from different purchasing models to detailed cost analysis. In this document, we’ll cover:

1. **Reserved Instances**
2. **Savings Plans**
3. **AWS Cost Explorer**

We will also review their use cases, pros and cons, and best practices for managing AWS spend.

## 1. Reserved Instances

### Overview
- **Reserved Instances (RIs)** allow you to commit to a certain instance type and region for 1 or 3 years.
- In return, you receive a significant discount (up to ~72% over On-Demand).

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Term**:
   - 1-year or 3-year commitment.
2. **Payment Options**:
   - **All Upfront**: Highest discount.
   - **Partial Upfront**: Moderate discount.
   - **No Upfront**: Lowest discount.
3. **Types**:
   - **Standard RIs**: Can’t change instance family.
   - **Convertible RIs**: Can change instance type within a family.
4. **Scope**:
   - **Regional** vs. **Zonal** (AZ-specific).

### Pros
- **Cost Savings**: Significant discount on steady-state workloads.
- **Predictable Billing**: Fixed capacity commitment.
- **Flexibility** (Convertible RIs): Swap to different instance families.

### Cons
- **Commitment**: Lock-in for 1 or 3 years.
- **Overcommitment Risk**: If usage changes, you might pay for unused capacity.
- **Complex Management**: Must track usage vs. RI coverage.

### Common Use Cases
- Consistent workloads (e.g., production web servers, databases) with steady compute demand.
- Lowering the total cost of ownership over the long term.

## 2. Savings Plans

### Overview
- **Savings Plans** offer flexible pricing models for compute usage (EC2, Fargate, Lambda) in exchange for a 1- or 3-year commitment to a specific hourly spend.
- Provide up to ~66% savings compared to On-Demand.

### Key Metrics & Numbers
1. **Types of Savings Plans**:
   - **Compute Savings Plans**: Apply to EC2 (any region, instance type), Fargate, and Lambda.
   - **EC2 Instance Savings Plans**: Specific instance family in a region.
2. **Term & Payment Options**: Same as RIs—1 or 3 years, all/partial/no upfront.
3. **Coverage**:
   - If usage exceeds the commit, the extra is charged at On-Demand rates.

### Pros
- **Flexibility**: Automatically applies to any compute usage.
- **Easy to Manage**: No need to match RIs to specific instance types.
- **Similar Discounts** to RIs without much overhead.

### Cons
- **Commitment**: Must commit to a certain spend.
- **Less Cost Savings** compared to some specialized RIs (especially if you know exactly which instance type you need).

### Common Use Cases
- Dynamic or flexible workloads that might change instance type or region.
- Organizations that want simpler cost management than RIs.

## 3. AWS Cost Explorer

### Overview
- **Visualization and analytics** tool for AWS bills and usage.
- Helps identify trends, forecast costs, and find areas to optimize.

### Key Features
1. **Dashboard**: Displays monthly costs and usage patterns.
2. **Filtering & Grouping**: Analyze costs by service, region, tag, or linked account.
3. **RI & Savings Plan Recommendations**: Suggests optimal commitments based on past usage.
4. **Forecasting**: Predict future spend based on historical trends.

### Pros
- **User-Friendly**: Graphical UI to explore usage data.
- **Recommendations**: Suggests RI or Savings Plan purchases.
- **Granular Insights**: Cost breakdown by tags, services, or accounts.

### Cons
- **Limited Customization**: Complex analyses may require external tools (e.g., Athena on CUR).
- **Data Lag**: Cost data can take up to 24 hours to update.

### Common Use Cases
- Monthly cost reporting.
- Identifying underutilized resources.
- Sizing reserved capacity commitments.

## Best Practices
1. **Tagging Strategy**
   - Use consistent tags (e.g., department, environment) to identify cost centers.
   - Improves cost visibility in Cost Explorer.

2. **Rightsizing**
   - Identify overprovisioned resources.
   - Downsize or switch to newer instance families.

3. **Auto Scaling & Serverless**
   - Match supply to demand to avoid paying for idle capacity.
   - Use serverless for spiky or unpredictable workloads.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Set budgets and alerts.
   - Use AWS Budgets for cost thresholds.

5. **Combine Approaches**
   - **RIs/Savings Plans** for baseline usage.
   - **Spot Instances** for burst or non-critical workloads.

## Quick Comparison Table
| Cost Optimization Model | Scope                                   | Pros                                         | Cons                                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Reserved Instances**  | Specific instance type/family           | Highest discount for known workloads         | Tied to specific usage, complex management  |
| **Savings Plans**       | Broader compute usage (EC2, Fargate, Lambda) | Simpler, flexible, still significant savings | Must commit to a spend, slightly less discount vs. RIs |
| **Cost Explorer**       | Reporting & analytics                   | Visual insights, usage reports, suggestions  | Data lag, might need external tools for deeper analysis |

## Final Thoughts
Achieving **cost efficiency** in AWS often involves a mix of strategies:
- **Reserved Instances** or **Savings Plans** for steady-state workloads.
- **Spot Instances** for fault-tolerant, flexible tasks.
- **Auto Scaling** and **serverless** approaches to handle variable workloads.
- **AWS Cost Explorer** to track usage and find opportunities to optimize.

By combining these tools and methods, you can ensure you’re not paying for underutilized resources while still maintaining the necessary capacity and performance for your applications.
